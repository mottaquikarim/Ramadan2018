*Simple Sehri/Iftar timetable consuming a prayer times API*


## Motivation

Oftentimes, sehri/iftar times are only available as images uploaded by local masjids. This can be frustrating to find, look up, etc.

This app connects to a patched version of **[this project](http://praytimes.org/manual)** (I found a bug with scope in the python implementation, my patch has not yet been submitted upstream because I did not see any way to achieve this on the code manual).
